DOCUMENT 1 — Aura_Orchestra PRD (Production Guide)
1. Purpose
Aura_Orchestra is a self‑governing, auditable, multi‑model AI production platform designed to transform a PRD into tested, documented, production‑ready software using a structured AI workforce with accountability, scoring, enforcement, and recovery.

2. Core Objectives
Deterministic task execution

Zero‑trust model participation

Full audit trail (1‑year retention)

Self‑healing infrastructure

Human‑in‑the‑loop authority retained

Multi‑OS compatibility (Windows dev / Linux prod)

3. System Roles (Functional)
Role	Responsibility
Director (Human)	Final authority, policy override
Manager (Orchestrator)	Task decomposition, routing
Employees (Models)	Task execution
Accountant	Scoring, promotion, penalties
Auditor	Evidence gathering, anomaly detection
HR	Rule enforcement, lifecycle control
API Gateway	Secure ingress
Web UI	Monitoring & control
MCP Interface	IDE control channel
4. Functional Requirements
4.1 Input Channels

Manager Chat (Director → Manager)

Group Chat (Manager ↔ Employees)

Monitoring Dashboard

Archive Viewer

IDE (MCP)

Single‑channel communication

Manager only

Employees assigned

Results logged

Auditor inspects evidence

Accountant scores performance

HR applies actions if needed

Manager reassigns failed tasks

Archive finalized outcome

4.3 Model Requirements
Each model runs in isolated container

Must implement BaseModelWorker interface

Must respond with telemetry

Can be terminated at any time

4.4 Scoring & Governance
Metrics include:

Accuracy

Consistency

Time to completion

Scope adherence

Retry count

Auditor violations

Manager satisfaction

4.5 Data Retention
Data	Retention
Logs	1 year
Incidents	1 year
Scores	1 year
Archives	1 year
Cleanup	Manual Director action only
5. Non‑Functional Requirements
≥99% uptime for Manager

Graceful degradation if model containers fail

Horizontal extensibility for models

No single point of failure

All secrets externalized

6. Production Readiness Criteria
✅ All services expose /health
✅ Auth & RBAC enforced
✅ Backups running
✅ CI passing
✅ No hardcoded keys
✅ Recovery tested
