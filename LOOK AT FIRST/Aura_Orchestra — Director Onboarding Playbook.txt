Aura_Orchestra — Director Onboarding Playbook
This is not optional reading.
This is how the system stays sane, safe, and effective.

1. Role of the Director (You)
You are not a user.

You are:

Final authority

Risk owner

Policy setter

Emergency override

Moral and legal anchor

No automated system replaces your accountability.

2. Mental Model to Adopt
Think of Aura_Orchestra as:

A company of highly capable but untrusted interns
They work fast, they forget things, and they must be supervised.

Your job is not to micromanage
Your job is to set rules and review outcomes.

3. How You Interact With the System
✅ Allowed Communication Channels
Web Interface

Strategic planning

Monitoring

Reviewing archives

Manual overrides

IDE via MCP

Tactical instructions

Production coding tasks

Strict Manager‑only interaction

You never talk directly to Employees.

4. How to Issue Instructions (Best Practice)
Bad instruction:

“Build an API.”

Good instruction:

“Build a FastAPI service with X endpoints, Postgres persistence, tests, and Dockerfile. Do not exceed scope. Report blockers.”

Remember:

Ambiguity = hallucinations

Precision = reliability

5. When to Intervene
You should step in when:

A task retries repeatedly

Two models disagree strongly

HR recommends termination

Auditor flags severe violations

The system behaves “confident but wrong”

Trust metrics — but verify outputs.

6. Promotions & Trust
Never permanently trust a model.

Promotions are contextual, not absolute

A Senior model today can fail tomorrow

Reputation decays by design

This protects you from silent regression.

7. Incident Handling Playbook
When an incident occurs:

Read the Auditor report

Confirm evidence

Allow HR to act

Let Manager reassign work

Review repaired output

Archive outcome

Never suppress incidents.
Silence is how systems rot.

8. System Health Checklist (Weekly)
✅ All services healthy

✅ Backups completed

✅ No stalled queues

✅ No silent model failures

✅ Scores trending normally

✅ Logs intact

If you skip this, you accept risk.

9. Scaling Responsibly
When adding more models:

Start in probation mode

Restrict task scope

Observe for 7–14 days

Only then increase autonomy

More models ≠ more quality
Governance scales quality.

10. Final Principle
Aura_Orchestra is powerful because it is constrained.

Freedom without rules creates chaos
Rules without humans create danger

Your presence as Director is what keeps the system aligned.
