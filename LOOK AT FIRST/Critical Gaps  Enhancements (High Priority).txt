🔴 Critical Gaps / Enhancements (High Priority)
These are the things that will bite you later if ignored.

1️⃣ Deterministic Reproducibility Layer (VERY IMPORTANT)
Problem
LLMs are probabilistic. When something goes wrong, you must be able to replay it.

Enhancement
Add Execution Snapshots per task:

Store per task:

model name + version

temperature / params

prompt hash

tool versions

repo commit hash

environment hash

✅ This allows:

forensic audits

legal defense

regression testing

“prove the model failed, not the spec”

New table:

CREATE TABLE execution_snapshots (
  task_id UUID,
  model_id TEXT,
  model_version TEXT,
  prompt_hash TEXT,
  params JSONB,
  env_hash TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
2️⃣ Formal Trust Boundaries Between Roles
Right now roles exist, but you should codify what they are ALLOWED to do.

Add a Capability Matrix
Role	May Write Code	May Modify Prompt	May Kill Model	May Access Logs
Director	✅	✅	✅	✅
Manager	✅	✅	✅	✅
Accountant	❌	❌	❌	✅
Auditor	❌	❌	❌	✅
Employee	✅ (sandbox only)	❌	❌	❌
✅ Enforce via:

API gates

service‑to‑service auth tokens

explicit deny rules

3️⃣ Model Prompt Contamination Protection
Threat
Models reading logs or outputs can poison future behavior.

Enhancement
Add:

Read‑only redacted logs for models

Never feed raw auditor findings back into prompt

Sanitization step before reuse of outputs

Think of it as air‑gapped memory planes:

Execution memory

Audit memory

Policy memory

They must never mix automatically.

4️⃣ Quota + Budget Enforcer (Hard Stop Layer)
You have scoring, but you need hard ceilings.

Add:
max tokens per task

max retries

max wall‑time per job

max concurrency per model

Example:

limits:
  tokens_max: 120_000
  retries_max: 2
  runtime_max_sec: 900
Manager must kill jobs that exceed this.

✅ Prevents:

infinite loops

GPU starvation

surprise cloud bills

5️⃣ Human Escalation Mode (Red Button)
When things go wrong, automation must stop cleanly.

Add:
Director “Pause Organization” switch

Freeze all queues

Allow inspection without mutation

This is essential for:

production incidents

legal review

data contamination events

6️⃣ Non‑Functional Testing (Often Forgotten)
You already test correctness. Also add:

✅ Load testing
✅ Failure injection (kill container mid‑task)
✅ Network partition tests
✅ Slow model simulation

This ensures your self‑healing claim is real.

7️⃣ Time‑Based Trust Decay
A model that was good 6 months ago may not be today.

Enhancement
Decay reputation over time:

effective_score = reputation * e^(-λ * age)
✅ Forces:

re‑validation

prevents “stale promotions”

keeps org adaptive

8️⃣ Cross‑Model Collusion Protection (Subtle but Real)
If multiple models validate each other, they can agree on wrong output.

Add:
at least one dissenting reviewer (different vendor or smaller model)

random challenge prompts

confidence divergence detection

If confidence is high but disagreement is high → flag for Auditor.

9️⃣ Secure Secret Handling (Do NOT rely only on .env)
Add:

Docker secrets or Vault

No plaintext API keys in logs

Automatic key rotation support

Critical once others deploy this.

10️⃣ Regulatory / Legal Safeguards (You’re close, but add this)
In license + code of conduct:

Explicit statement that models are tools, not agents

Liability separation between Director & system

Audit trail as “best effort compliance”

This protects you later.

🟢 Nice‑to‑Have (Phase 2 Enhancements)
Model “benchmarks” leaderboard

Skill tagging (e.g. backend, infra, docs)

Project‑level scoring rollups

Predictive failure detection

“Shadow mode” model testing (runs but doesn’t affect output)

🧠 Big Picture Reality Check
You’re not building:

“Another AI agent system”

You’re building:

An AI operating organization with governance, law, economics, and accountability

That’s rare — and valuable.
